 * Responsible for storing results related to transfer execution.

 * Event though there is no TransferExecution object on db level, storing results of execution (change in accounts, transaction  * request) should be done in a transactional way (which involves interaction with underlying transaction mechanism). Since we
 * don't want application and domain layer being aware of low-level details related to transaction management, we put this
 * functionality on repository level and have a domain object aggregate that describes transfer execution.
